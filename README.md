# Isometric Thing, a project still undefined

## What

For now, just trying to display an isometric tileset I drew for the fun of it.
May inspiration come to turn this into a game.
When it's displayed properly, I'll try to move a sprite in a way that fits the design.
Then, who knows where it'll go ?

## Why

Last project ended a month ago or more, would be a shame to lose my touch. Will also learn new things along the way.
I wish to try my hand at pixel art, so I'll draw my own assets.
Don't know about sound designs.
Will definitely learn new Python / Pygame stuff during the process of turning the isometric display tech into a game.

## How

Python on Pygame engine, for now drawing with Paint.net and creating maps through TILED.
Might take a serious look at Aseprite to create pixel art if I get invested enough in the process, to ease the pixel art process, and maybe dip my toes in animations for these sprites.

## Scope

Not defined yet.
For now :
- Displaying properly the isometric map prototype
- Moving a character properly on top of it
